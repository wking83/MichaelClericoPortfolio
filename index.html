    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Michael Clerico, I am currently a High School Teacher. I have a strong passion for technology which has led me to become a Computer Science educator specializing in Cloud Computing with Azure. The Computer Science program at SNHU has pushed my technical abilities and shaped my goals professionally. Each milestone in this final course has taken all my skills and put them together in one professional culminating project. I have utilized my skills in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and security. I have learned how to solve problems collaboratively in this process also. My ePortfolio showcases my journey through the program and how through iterative design I can showcase a real-world presentation of real-world technology. It also demonstrates my ability to diagnose and optimize systems through modern practices. </p>

    <hr class="rule" />

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I really try to look at software problems through a holistic view. I try to analyze the program from data flow, security, and design architecture. Each class in my program helped develop skills I need to create Horrea Heroes. In CS-340 (Client/Server Development) I implemented CRUD systems utilizing JSON models. In CS-360 (Mobile Architecture) I then utilized those same CRUD systems but with SQLite local models. These now prepare me to utilize Firebase and a cloud-based NoSQL model. Through this process I learned to analyze tradeoffs between models and comparing on-device and cloud-based systems. </p>

    <hr class="rule" />

    <h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>
    <p>As an educator I thoroughly understand the value of collaboration and communication. This skill has easily translated into my developer role. I have leaned on Co-Workers to help me with my coursework and growth. Through teaching I have learned to communicate with both technical and non-technical audiences clearly. The ability to communicate to different stakeholders about tradeoffs, design choices, and functionality will be vital for my transition into project management. </p>

    <hr class="rule" />

    <h2>Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Data structures and algorithms have been a crucial part of my growth in the computer science field. Within Horrea Heroes, I identified using HashMaps for lookups to achieve (O(1)) lookup speeds. I also understood tradeoffs with HashMaps as they pertain to the UI. So, I decided to keep MutableLists to continue support recycler view functionality. This helps showcase my ability to understand tradeoffs and balance performance and experience. This skill is extremely valuable in the Project Management field.</p>

    <hr class="rule" />

    <h2>Software Engineering and Databases</h2>
    <p>The most significant change to my inventory management program came with the migration from Java/SQLite to Kotlin/Firebase architecture. I had to convert the entire application logic to implement Kotlin coroutines to utilize asynchronous database handling. Then I had to integrate the software with NoSQL Firestore on the backend. I ran into many Gradle dependency and plug in version issues. I had to restructure build files and keep consistency across JVM targets. This part of the project helps me grow foundationally with modular design and asynchronous data synchronization. These are fundamentals that are necessary when dealing with scalable systems within a cloud environment.</p>

    <hr class="rule" />

    <h2>Security and Authentication</h2>
    <p>Utilizing Firebase Authentication, I created a secure access point that handles account creation, sign in, and password recovery. By utilizing Coroutine Lifecycle Management, I was able to separate authentication from UI layers to prevent memory leaks. This ensures a responsive and secure user experience.  This concept I continually emphasis in my classroom. The importance of software security, user privacy, and data integrity. </p>

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <h3>Software Design and Engineering â€“ Java -> Kotlin</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/wking83/MichaelClericoPortfolio/tree/Software-Design">Software Design Artifact</a></p>
    <p>Showcases my ability to modernize legacy code. I migrated an entire Android application from Java to Kotlin. I had to rethink the architecture and understand where to implement coroutines. I had to resolve Gradle dependency conflicts. Then lasty I had to ensure the utilization of Kotlinâ€™s null handling features. It shows my knowledge of object-oriented principles. It shows my ability to refactor code and rebuild critical system components within a software engineering profession. </p>

    <h3>Database and Cloud Integration â€“ Firebase NoSQL</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/wking83/MichaelClericoPortfolio/tree/Database">Database Artifact</a></p>
    <p>The next improvement I made was to replace the local SQLite backend with Firebase Firestore cloud. This made it possible to have a inventory application that had real time updates. I implemented my CRUD operations and user authentication through Firebase Authentication and FirestoreInventoryRepository.kt. This shows my ability to design cloud architectures that are scalable. I was able to manage data securely behind a secure access control system. </p>

    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ HashMap + MutableList</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/wking83/MichaelClericoPortfolio/tree/Algorithms-and-Data-Structure">Algorithms Artifact</a></p>
    <p>I was able to apply the knowledge of databases and picking the correct algorithm to maximize efficiency. I decided to optimize data retrieval through HashMaps to create 0(1) speed of access. I kept MutableLists to maintain UI order within RecyclerView. This ensures the UI remains stable and balances performance and user experience and further displays my understanding of tradeoff in the real-world setting.</p>
