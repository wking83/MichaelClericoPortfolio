## Introduction
My name is **Michael Clerico**. I am currently a high school teacher with a strong passion for technology, which led me to become a Computer Science educator. The Computer Science program at SNHU pushed my technical abilities and shaped my professional goals. Each milestone in this final course brought my skills together into one culminating project. I utilized software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and securityâ€”and learned to solve problems collaboratively throughout the process.  

This ePortfolio showcases my journey through the program and demonstrates iterative design in a real-world context. It also highlights my ability to diagnose and optimize systems using modern practices.

## Process
I approach software problems holisticallyâ€”considering data flow, security, and architecture.  
- In **CS-340 (Client/Server Development)** I implemented CRUD systems with JSON models.  
- In **CS-360 (Mobile Architecture)** I reused those CRUD patterns with SQLite local models.  
- These experiences prepared me to adopt **Firebase** and a **cloud-based NoSQL** model.

Through this process, I analyzed trade-offs between on-device and cloud-based systems.

## Collaboration & Communication
As an educator, I value collaboration and clear communication. These skills transfer directly to software development. Iâ€™ve learned to communicate with both technical and non-technical audiences about trade-offs, design choices, and functionalityâ€”key for my transition into project management.

## Data Structures
Data structures and algorithms have been central to my growth. In **Horrea Heroes**, I selected **HashMap** lookups to achieve **O(1)** access for performance-critical paths while keeping **MutableList** structures to preserve UI order for `RecyclerView`. This demonstrates my ability to balance performance and user experienceâ€”an essential skill in real-world software.

## Software Engineering & Databases
The most significant change to my inventory management app was the migration from **Java/SQLite** to **Kotlin/Firebase**:
- Converted core logic to Kotlin and implemented **coroutines** for async operations.
- Integrated **Firestore** for a cloud NoSQL backend.
- Resolved Gradle dependency/version alignment and JVM target consistency issues.

These changes strengthened my foundation in modular design and asynchronous data syncâ€”key fundamentals for scalable, cloud-based systems.

## Security & Authentication
Using **Firebase Authentication**, I implemented secure account creation, sign-in, and password recovery. With coroutine-aware lifecycle management, I separated auth from UI layers to avoid leaks and keep the app responsive. I emphasize software security, user privacy, and data integrity in both my work and my classroom.
