  I selected this artifact because it shows my ability to transform a Java application and migrate logic into a more modern Kotlin application. I implemented coroutines to handle operations with SQLite. I had to update plug in versions and change the structure of the program to operate. In the end it also showed my ability to not only build software but to diagnose and resolve issues. I introduced coroutines to manage SQLite operation asynchronously. This helps maintain responsiveness within the app. I was also able to remove nested callbacks that are required in Javas threaded model. This in the end makes reading the code easier and prevents screen freezes on read and write functions. I follow a Model View View Model structure when handling my UI logic and separated data handling. All the database operations were separated in their own layer (InventoryDatabase) while the UI is being updated.


  I planned to use this artifact to showcase my ability to apply best practices within Software engineering and design. I ran into Gradle issues and dependency mismatches. I had to demonstrate debugging skills and ability to implement tool chain management. I ran into issues with plugins and dependencies as it relates to the location of root and app placement. I learned I must keep plugins in the root folder and dependences in the module level file. I had to configure gradle.properties and settings.gradle.kts to ensure JVM targets are consistent. I had to carefully ensure my XML IDS, adapter bindings, and database definitions were kept true. Overcoming these build problems has given me confidence to handle system build problems.
